- 👋 Hi, I’m @George Mulak
- 👀 I’m interested in so many things.  I really like Ubuntu Linux a lot.  
In fact, I work with a friend, Nathan H. on SCaLE almost every year in the
Pomona California area collaborating and promoting Ubuntu Linux.  I also try to help 
people install Linux on refurbished machines to those people who don't have one.  

- 🌱 I’m currently learning NextCloud server.  I am also learning HTML and CSS along with DIVI theme in WordPress
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on helping people test their new projects, especially if they are open source and/or cross platform
